          "reviewDescription":"I am a beginner in terms of photography. The telephoto lens are really good and pictures taken with then are truly awesome. They give the photos kind of a depth field perception in auto mode. The camera itself has heck lot of options and having a touchscreen really helps"

          "reviewDescription":"For a beginner, this is more than you can bargain for. It has a fairly decent f stop range for you to play around and control exposure.The best part is, it has all the requirements of a DSLR, as in i was surprised to see it has exposure metering modes as well. So when i was learning from a tutorial, whatever photography jargon they threw around i could try it on the camera.The camera itself is very light. The lens make it a little bit heavy. I found the bag to be a bit small. It doesn't fit well with the lens on."
